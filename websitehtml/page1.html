        <h3>Skills and technique required for the game!</h3>
        <li>Serving: There are various serving techniques, including the underhand serve, overhand serve, jump serve, and float serve. Focus on consistency and accuracy while serving to keep your opponents off balance.</li>
        <li>Passing: Passing, also known as bumping, involves using the forearms to control the ball and pass it to a teammate. Maintain a wide base and angle your platform towards your target to achieve better control.</li>
        <li>Setting: Setting is the act of directing the ball to a teammate for an attack. Use your fingertips to cushion the ball and deliver it precisely to your hitter.</li>
        <li>Hitting: Also known as spiking, hitting is the offensive aspect of volleyball where players attempt to score points by hitting the ball over the net with force and accuracy. Focus on timing, footwork, and arm swing to maximize your hitting power.</li>
        <li>Blocking: Blocking is a defensive technique used to deflect or block the opponent's attack at the net. Anticipate your opponent's movements and position yourself to block their hitting lanes effectively.</li>
